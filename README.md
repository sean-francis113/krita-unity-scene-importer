# Unity Importer For Krita Scenes
A Unity Engine Importer to use with my Krita Scene Exporter, but can be used with similar exported data.

**Why One Script?**

I am working with one script right now for two main reasons:
1) A planned feature is for the ability to add custom Keyword Handlers in the script, and I want it to be easy for the user to find the script, find where their new handler functionality is, and alter it as needed.
2) It is easy for me to develop with only one script.

However, the idea to use multiple scripts is being considered.

**Known Issues:**
* No Implementation of the Importer. That is currently being worked on.
* Despite attempts, Serialization fails to save data between uses of the Custom Window. That is currently being worked on.
